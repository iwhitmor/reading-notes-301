# Summary

## Readings from class 301

* The readings for class 301 do a great job at laying out the overall structure of the class prior to learning the topics in daily lecture. The readings give us supplemental material to what we are learning in daily lectures, and what we are implementing into our projects during our daily lab time.

* Some of the topics we got introduced to in our 301 class readings:

  * React and Components

    * State and Props

    * Passing functions as props

    * React forms

  * Node.js

  * REST
  
  * API's

  * Functional Programming

  * MongoDB and Mongoose

  * CRUD

  * Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

* I enjoy doing the readings prior to class becuase they align with the material that we learn after doing the readings and it helps to understand what we are learning. I suppose you could do the readings after, but it is designed for us to have an understanding of the material ahead of time, which makes sense.
