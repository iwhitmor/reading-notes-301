# State and Props


## React State vs Props - [State vs Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh3dYM6Keuw)

- 2 ways data get handled in React: Through state and props

- Rendered only in javascript and changed in the DOM only if there is an actual change

- State only gets used if component has internal value that only affects that component and doesn't affect any other part of the app

- No matter how many components change, only update DOM with actual element changes when the tree rendered

## State and Lifecycle: [State & Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

- State is similar to props, but is private and fully controlled by the component

## Handling Events: [Handling events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

- React events are named using camelCase instead of lowercase

- With JSX you pass a function as an event handler and not a string
