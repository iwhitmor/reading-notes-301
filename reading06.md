# Node.JS

## [An intro to Node.js on sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

* What is node.js?

  * Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

## [Reasons for pair programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

* What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

  * Greater efficiency

  * Engaged collaboration

  * Learning from fellow students

  * Social skills

  * Job interview readiness

  * Work environment readiness
  
* In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

  * I like pair programming because it helps me learn in a different way. When I see someone else coding the same stuff that I am supposed to, but in a different manner it helps me to see different ways that they are learning. I also like the engaged collaboration. It helps to talk to someone else and work out problems together, rather than just ask for help from a teacher in class

* How does pair programming work?

  * It involves two roles. The driver, and the navigator. The driver codes while the navigator tells them and helps them along the way. Then the roles switch so the person who was the navigator becomes the driver and so on. The navigator thinks about the big picture and also checks the drivers code for errors. The navigator should not be writing any code
