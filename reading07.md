* Who is Roy Fielding?

  * One of the creators oF HTTP and the REST (Representational State Transfer) architechtural style

* Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

  * Because they weren't designed to be used like that. Most developers created techniques to get computers to talk to each other that didn't have the requirements they needed

* What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

  * Tells the browser what protocol to use. Capable of telling something the location of anything, anywhere on the web

* What does a GET do?

  * The browser goes at out 'GETS' the URL that you typed and brings back the web page. Same thing with images, videos, etc, it goes out and 'GETS' them, and brings them back to the page

* What does a POST do?

  * One system needs to add something to another system it uses 'POST'

  * One system wants to replace something it another system it uses 'PUT'
